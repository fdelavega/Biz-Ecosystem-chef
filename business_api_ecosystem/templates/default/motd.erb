Welcome to the Business API Ecosystem!

The current VM has been generated using the existing chef cookbook.
If this is the first time you access to the VM there are some topics
to be considered:

1) The current installation comes with a default configuration, which
needs to be modified in order to use the system:

   - You have to register the application in the FIWARE IdM (https://account.lab.fiware.org/)
      - URL: http://your_cloud_ip:<%= node[:biz][:port]%>
      - Callback URL: http://your_cloud_ip:<%= node[:biz][:port]%>/auth/fiware/callback

   - Update the config.js file of the Logic proxy component with the 
     OAuth2 params (Client id,client secret, and callback url). 
     This file is located in /opt/biz-ecosystem/business-ecosystem-logic-proxy

   - Optionally, you can include email configuration, if you want 
     your instance to send notifications by email. To do that fill
     the email settings located in the settings.py file of the 
     Business Charging Backend
     This file is located in /opt/biz-ecosystem/business-charging-backend/src

2) The chef client runs periodically, that means that just 
including the configuration info in the components file is not 
enough, since they can be overriden. To deal with this issue 
include your configuration settings in the biz-conf.json file
located in /opt/biz-ecosystem. This way, the chef client will 
use the information included in this file when generating the 
configuration templates.

3) The different components of the Business API Ecosystem are included
as services. You can run them as follows:

   - sudo service glasfish-domain1 restart
   - sudo service business-charging restart
   - sudo service business-proxy restart
